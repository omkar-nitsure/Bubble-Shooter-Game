                                               "FEATURES IMPLEMENTED"

1]I have created bubbles of two different sizes(radius = 10 and 20) and colours(blue and pink)
  so that there are 3 small bubbles and 2 bigger bubbles at the beginning of the game.

2]I have added acceleration in y direction for both bubbles to produce parabolic trajectory.

2]I have added the feature that bubbles bounces off both the horizontal ground and top border.

3]I have introduced the collision between a bubble and a bullet so that score increases by 1 when a bullet hits a bubble.

4]If bullet hits the bigger bubble then the bubble splits in 2 small bubbles and bullet is destroyed.

5]If bullet hits the smaller bubble then both the bubble and bullet disappear. 

6]I have introduced the collision between a bubble and the shooter,
  and the health continues to decrease as long as the bubble is in contact with the shooter.

7]I have added texts which display score ,health and time remaining in the game.Initially score is 0.
  Player gets 30 units of health and 50 units of time at the start of the game.

8]Player wins if all bubbles are destroyed and a "congratulations!!" message is displayed.
  Game ends if either health is used up or time is over and a "Game over" message is displayed.
